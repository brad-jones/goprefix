# Color Chooser

This example demonstrates how the `colorchooser` can be used.

## Expected Output

_Sorry markdown doesn't really support colors... I guess I could embed an image_

```
<color1>foo</color1>
<color1>foo</color1>
<color2>bar</color2>
```

> There will also be an additional 3 lines which represent the custom chooser
  in the example, which only has 2 colors so the output will be random,
  a bit hard to represent above.
